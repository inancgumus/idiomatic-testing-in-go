>
> **Topics covered:**
> - Why should you read this book?
> - Importance of writing idiomatic and testable code
> - Introducing Go's big features

#### [Chapter 2: Go Crash Course](all-listings/02-go-crash-course/README.md)

> This chapter is a fast-paced primer designed to prepare experienced programmers for the advanced topics we'll explore throughout the book. While most chapters focus on projects, this one highlights Go's distinctive features and mechanics through concise examples.
>
> **Topics covered:**
> - Modules and packages.
> - Object-oriented programming.
> - Concurrent programming.

#### [Chapter 3: Idiomatic Testing](all-listings/03-idiomatic-testing/README.md)

> Covers testing.

#### [Chapter 4: Test Coverage and Performance Optimization](all-listings/04-test-coverage-and-performance-optimization/README.md)

> Covers benchmarking.

#### [Chapter 5: Structuring Command-Line Programs](all-listings/05-structuring-command-line-programs/README.md)

> This chapter explores two key approaches to flag parsing:
>   - Using the `os` package to handle raw command-line input.
>   - Using the `flag` package for structured flag parsing.
>
> We'll first build a custom parser using the `os` package to gain a deeper understanding of how flag parsing works under the hood and help us explore more advanced Go concepts, such as escape analysis, memory management, error handling, and so on.
>
> **Topics covered:**
> - Crafting idiomatic and user-friendly command-line programs.
> - Parsing command-line arguments and flags.
> - Extending the flag package's functionality by satisfying interfaces.
> - Retrieving and using positional arguments for mandatory arguments.
> - Validating command-line arguments and flags.
